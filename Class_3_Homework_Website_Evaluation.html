            <p>
            Amazon.com uses a dark gray as the main color with an orange secondary color.  The color matches even though it is so simple.
            </p>
                
            <p>
            The primary users of the site are adult ages 18-55 and the chosen design works well because of its simplicity and welcoming feel.
            </p>
            <p>
            User tasks are to purchase items or price match and it is very easy to do.  The user may also sign up for one-click purchasing inorder to make the process faster. 
              <br />
            This benfits the company more than the user, because they are more likely to comppulsively purchase items.  
            </p>
            <p>
                This site provides an excellent and user friendly experience. 
            </p>

            <div>
            <p>
            Facebook.com is another website that I frequently visit.  The primary color is blue and there is a ton of white.
            <br />
            I feel that this is welcoming and matches the site. 
            </p>
            <p>
            The primary users for this site is pretty general and the design caters the audience due to its simplicity.  
            </p>
            <p>
            Users tasks and goals are to stalk family and friends. This task is very easy to do as it is easy to search for
            <br />
            who you want or just scroll through the news feed.
            </p>
            <p>
            User experience is excellent, and makes the user constantly frequent the website.
            </p>

        <h1>Southwest Airlines</h1>
        <img src= "http://www.logospike.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Southwest_Airlines_Logo_02.jpg" alt= "southwest" style="width:500px;height:300px;"/>
         <div>
            <p>
            Southwest Airlines is another site I frequent.  The site main color is blue with a soft gray over lying the website.  
            <br />
            There is an image in the bakc ground that stays in position as the user scrolls giving the page depth.
            </p>
            <p>
            The gray fades from light gray into white gradually.  This site is very smooth.  
            </p>
            <p>
            Primary users on this site are men and women ages 24-44 and the layout is very well done. 
            <br />
            The goal is to search for flights and book.  The site does cater to its user by making it simple and has such an easy layout. 
             </p>
            <p>
            I believe the site does provide a great user experience. When booking flight they have the low fare calender
            <br />
            which shows how much the flights cost on any day of the month.  Google Flights now uses the same funtionality for its users. 
            </p>
